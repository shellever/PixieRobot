This is a sample of Turing Robot usage. It use two kind of http request mode -- `POST` & `GET` -- to connect the remote server. And then it can automatically be translated to proper language environment according to the system settings, that is `i18n`. Your can create a customized Robot through the [`Turing Robot website`][1]. If you have to learn the more details, please download it. 
Thanks to [`Hongyang blogs`][2] for giving me a lots of help.
